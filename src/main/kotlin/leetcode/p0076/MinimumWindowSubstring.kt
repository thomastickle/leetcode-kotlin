/**
 * # 76. Minimum Window Substring
 *
 * Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return the **minimum window
 * substring** of `s` such that every character in `t` (**including duplicates**) is included in the
 * window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string `""`.
 *
 * The testcases will be generated such that the answer is **unique**.
 *
 * Examples:
 * - Input: `s = "ADOBECODEBANC"`, `t = "ABC"`. Output: `"BANC"`.
 *   Explanation: The minimum window substring `"BANC"` includes `'A'`, `'B'`, and `'C'` from string `t`.
 * - Input: `s = "a"`, `t = "a"`. Output: `"a"`.
 *   Explanation: The entire string `s` is the minimum window.
 * - Input: `s = "a"`, `t = "aa"`. Output: `""`.
 *   Explanation: Both `'a'`s from string `t` must be included in the window.
 *   Since the largest window of `s` only has one `'a'`, return empty string.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - `m == s.length`
 * - `n == t.length`
 * - `1 <= m, n <= 10^5`
 * - `s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.
 *
 * Follow up: Could you find an algorithm that runs in `O(m + n)` time?
