/**
 * # 12. Integer to Roman
 *
 * Seven different symbols represent Roman numerals with the following values:
 *
 * | Symbol | Value |
 * | :--- | :--- |
 * | `I` | 1 |
 * | `V` | 5 |
 * | `X` | 10 |
 * | `L` | 50 |
 * | `C` | 100 |
 * | `D` | 500 |
 * | `M` | 1000 |
 *
 * Roman numerals are formed by appending the conversions of decimal place values from highest to lowest.
 * Converting a decimal value to a Roman numeral has the following rules:
 * - If the value does not start with 4 or 9, select the symbol of the maximal value that can be subtracted
 *   from the input, append that symbol to the result, subtract its value, and convert the remainder to a Roman numeral.
 * - If the value starts with 4 or 9 use the subtractive form representing one symbol subtracted from the following
 *   symbol, for example, 4 is 1 (`I`) less than 5 (`V`): `IV` and 9 is 1 (`I`) less than 10 (`X`): `IX`.
 *   Only the following subtractive forms are used: 4 (`IV`), 9 (`IX`), 40 (`XL`), 90 (`XC`), 400 (`CD`) and 900 (`CM`).
 * - Only powers of 10 (`I`, `X`, `C`, `M`) can be appended consecutively at most 3 times to represent multiples of 10.
 *   You cannot append `V`, `L`, or `D` multiple times. If you need to append a symbol 4 times use the subtractive form.
 *
 * Given an integer `num`, convert it to a Roman numeral.
 *
 * Examples:
 * - Input: `num = 3749`. Output: `"MMMDCCXLIX"`.
 *   Explanation: `3000 = MMM`, `700 = DCC`, `40 = XL`, `9 = IX`.
 * - Input: `num = 58`. Output: `"LVIII"`.
 *   Explanation: `50 = L`, `8 = VIII`.
 * - Input: `num = 1994`. Output: `"MCMXCIV"`.
 *   Explanation: `1000 = M`, `900 = CM`, `90 = XC`, `4 = IV`.
 * - Input: `num = 3`. Output: `"III"`.
 *   Explanation: `3 = III`.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - `1 <= num <= 3999`
